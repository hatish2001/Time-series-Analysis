LSTM Model for Time Series Prediction
Project Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the process of building, training, and evaluating a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for time series prediction. The project aims to showcase the application of LSTMs in forecasting tasks, leveraging their ability to understand and predict patterns in sequential data.

Contents
LSTM_Model.ipynb: The main Jupyter notebook with the entire workflow, including data preprocessing, model construction, training, and evaluation.
data/: Directory containing the datasets used in the model (if applicable).
requirements.txt: A file listing all the necessary Python packages for running the notebook.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine. The project depends on several Python libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, TensorFlow, and Keras.

Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd <repository-name>
Install the required Python packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To run the Jupyter notebook:

Start Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Open the LSTM_Model.ipynb file in the Jupyter interface.

Run the cells sequentially to see each step in the process, from data loading to model evaluation.
