# LSTM, SARIMA, ARIMA Model for Time Series Prediction

## Project Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the process of building, training, and evaluating a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for time series prediction. The project aims to showcase the application of LSTMs in forecasting tasks, leveraging their ability to understand and predict patterns in sequential data.

## Contents

- `LSTM_Model.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook with the entire workflow, including data preprocessing, model construction, training, and evaluation.
- `data/`: Directory containing the datasets used in the model (if applicable).
- `requirements.txt`: A file listing all the necessary Python packages for running the notebook.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine. The project depends on several Python libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, TensorFlow, and Keras.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>

## Usage
jupyter notebook
Usage
- To run the Jupyter notebook:

- Start Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:
- Open the LSTM_Model.ipynb file in the Jupyter interface.
- Open the SARIMAX.ipynb for the ARIMA and SARIMA model

- Run the cells sequentially to see each step in the process, from data loading to model evaluation.

## Contributing
- Contributions to improve the model or extend the project are welcome. Please feel free to fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
